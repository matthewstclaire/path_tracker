# Path Tracker

## About

Path Tracker is an interactive platform inspired by a gym I currently attend known as The Sect. Members of The Sect currently keep track of their progress through a piece of paper known as their "Path." I made this application as a means to help streamline the process of the path. Through this app you're able to track daily workouts and check progress on your path.
