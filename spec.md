Specifications for the Rails Assessment
Specs:

 [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project

 [x] Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y; e.g. User has_many Recipes)

 [x] Include at least one belongs_to relationship (x belongs_to y; e.g. Post belongs_to User)

 [x] Include at least two has_many through relationships (x has_many y through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients)

 [x] Include at least one many-to-many relationship (x has_many y through z, y has_many x through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items throughIngredients, Item has_many Recipes through Ingredients)

 [] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute, that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)

 [x] Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)

 [] Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)

 [x] Include signup (how e.g. Devise)

 [x] Include login (how e.g. Devise)

 [x] Include logout (how e.g. Devise)

 [x] Include third party signup/login (how e.g. Devise/OmniAuth)

 [x] Include nested resource show or index (URL e.g. users/2/recipes)

 [] Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients/new)

 [] Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)

Confirm:

 The application is pretty DRY
 Limited logic in controllers
 Views use helper methods if appropriate
 Views use partials if appropriate


Project To-Do's
Throughout: Keep in mind partials and helpers -- for use in views 
-[x] map out your project models - include tables, attr, fields, relationships - as you expect them to be
-[x] generate rails with - rails new NAME
-[x] if devise:
    - install devise immediately
    - generate user model and all devise structures
    - add in omniauth & 3rd party authentication
-[ ] if not devise:
    - generate user/s model
    - build out authentication
        -using bcrypt
    - add in omniauth & 3rd party authentication
-[x] generate your migrations for your tables
    -make sure that you do your join tables last (in order to take advantage of the macros in rails)
        - migrations should be in order from parent to join
        - t.belongs_to :thing >> this is how you use the macro
            - this will add the belongs_to line in your models --- make sure you don't have doubles
-[x] add in models for all of the tables
-[x] add in all of relationships in the models
-[x] test relationships in rails console
    - create some objects and create associated objects (rails c -s)
-[x] make seed data
-[x] write your routes
-[x] make CRUD routes for one of your parent controllers (note: parent controller examples - the 'owners', has the "has many through)
    - [x]make associated views for those
-[ ] build out the rest of the functionality
*** At this point look for redundancies, DRY up your code using partials and helpers ***
-[ ] scope methods
-[x] validations
-[ ] test all forms and features
-[ ] styling, if you want to
    - CSS, HTML, bootstrap, materialize, JS
